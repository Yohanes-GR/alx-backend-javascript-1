## Resources
### For this project, students are expected to look at this concept:
* [Advanced Python](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/136)
### Read or watch:
* [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
* [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/), without the help of Google:
### General
* Type annotations in Python 3
* How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
* Duck typing
* How to validate your code with ```mypy```

## Requirements
* A ```README.md``` file.
* All your files should end with a new line.

## Tasks
* [x] 0. Basic annotations - add
* [x] 1. Basic annotations - concat
* [x] 2. Basic annotations - floor
* [x] 3. Basic annotations - to string
* [x] 4. Define variables
* [x] 5. Complex types - list of floats
* [x] 6. Complex types - mixed list
* [x] 7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
* [x] 8. Complex types - functions
* [x] 9. Let's duck type an iterable object
* [x] 10. Duck typing - first element of a sequence
* [x] 11. More involved type annotations
* [x] 12. Type Checking
